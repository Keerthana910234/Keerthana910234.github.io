# Hi, I'm Keerthana Arun. Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD student in the Bioengineering department at the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to this, I worked with Prof. Yogesh Goyal at Northwestern University as a research assistant. I studied Physics as an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.

I am interested in understanding how life, at cellular to organism scales, is able to process, transmit and decode information. And how we, as humans, can peek into living beings, including ourselves, to understand the underlying principles in a quantitative way.
