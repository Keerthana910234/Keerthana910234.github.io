## Light and temperature sensing proteins



## Gene regulatory interaction inference using twin cells

Transcription factors are known to play a major role in establishing and maintaining cell identity, and their interactions are frequently disrupted in disease states such as cancer. Inferring gene regulatory networks is therefore an important problem, but remains challenging due to noisy measurements and indirect interactions, among other factors. Recently divided "twin" cells offer a powerful tool to address this: they can help distinguish between multiple co-existing cell states and infer the directionality of regulatory relationships using two static single-cell RNA measurements combined with lineage tracing.
