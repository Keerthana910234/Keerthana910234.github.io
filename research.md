Gene regulatory interaction inference
==========================================
Transcription factors have been shown to play a major role in establishing and maintaining cell identity. Similarly, their interactions are often affected in disease states, like cancer. This makes inferring gene regulatory networks an important problem but it is difficult due to many reasons: noisy measurements, indirect interactions among others. Twin cells, recently divided cells, can be used to discern if there are multiple cell states (thus, appearing to be regulating each other but in reality, are not really regulating each other) and also infer directionality of regulations with two static single-cell RNA measurements.
